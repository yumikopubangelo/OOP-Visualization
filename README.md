# OOP-Visualization

In this project, I am working on visualizing statistical data about aircraft accidents that occurred from 1945 to 2010. The approach I am taking to build this project is by using the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm in the Python programming language.

By employing OOP, I am designing a program structure consisting of classes representing various related entities, such as aircraft, statistical data, and possibly also classes for graphical visualization.
Each class has attributes and methods corresponding to its function in this project.

For example, the Aircraft class could have attributes such as the year of the accident, aircraft type, and location of the incident, as well as methods for accessing and manipulating this data. The DataStatistics class may be responsible for collecting data from external sources, analyzing it, and providing an interface for accessing the data. Meanwhile, the visualization class will utilize processed data to create informative graphs or plots.

With the use of OOP, I can separate different responsibilities and functionalities into clearly defined units, making it easier to manage and update the code, and facilitating collaboration among team members involved in this project. Additionally, with the OOP approach, I can create code that is more modular and understandable, thus facilitating maintenance and further development in the future.
